# COM4008-Programming-Concepts
This is the template repository for COM4008 Programming Concepts.

It contains lecture slides, links to lecture recordings and resources, in addition to code and project files to get started. 
Make sure that you 'use this template' or at least 'fork' this repository, to ensure that you can commit any local changes that you make. 

This module is designed to introduce you to the most mainstream programming languages, from C in the 1970s, C++ in the 1980s, Python late 1980s, Java mid 1990s, and C# in the early 2000s. JavaScript and its associated libraries (React, Node, Next etc etc) are omitted as they are covered in the COM4011 Web Development.
