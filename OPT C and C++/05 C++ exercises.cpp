* Exercise 1: 
* Write C++ code that will ask the user to enter their name and age. 
* Store these values entered from the keyboard in variables and then output them to the screen.
* 
* If you've already written this in C, will it compile and run using C++ or do you have to make modifications?
*
* Remember types and semi-colons in C/C++!

* Exercise 2: 
* Now write a for loop in C++ that will repeat five times and print the value of the loop counter to the screen.

* Print the values on the same line: 1,2,3,4,5
* Then also modify the loop so it prints each value on a new line:

* Exercise 3: 
* Write a series of conditional statements that will output the lettergrade for a mark between 0 to 100.
* You may have already written this in Python (or C), so feel free to translate the code into C++!
* 
* Extension: Create a C++ function that will also convert lettergrades (e.g. 'A', 'B', 'C') 
* to University degree classifications (e.g. "1st", "2:1", "2:2"). Can you write a switch statement to do this?
* If you already have the switch function in C, will it run in C++ as it is or do you have to change it?

* Exercise 4: 
* 
* Define a C array which is fixed-size and can store 5 integers. 
* Assign the values 1 to 5, each to an indivdiual elememt of the integer array.
* Output the contents of the array to the screen.
* 
* Now write an array which allocate these same values to an array that allocates memory dynamically.
* Hint: use the keyword 'new'.
* 
* To visualise the dynamic memory allocation, print the memory addresses - use the & reference.
* Re-run the function and watch how the memory is allocated in different places each time.

/* Exercise 5
*  Further to the struct in C, C++ introduced classes which allow attributes 
*  to be encapsulated together with functions (now known as 'methods' in OOP terms).
*  
*  Complete the class definition of Student below. Then instantiate this class to create a student object. 
*  
*  Extension 1: Create objects via calling the constructor directly, and then using the 'new' keyword. 
*  (cont.)    : Print their memory locations and observe whether there are differences.
* 
*  Extension 2: Create an array that stores references (points to) dynamic instances (objects) of the Student class.
*  (cont.)    : Print the memory address for each object referred to by this array. Re-run this function and notice what happens to the memmory locations.
